<h1>WELCOME TO AVON VALE TENNIS AND CROQUET CLUB</h1>


<p>Avon Vale Tennis and Croquet Club (AVTCC) is a small, friendly club situated 
in the village of Avonwick in the heart of Devon’s beautiful South Hams, a few miles south of South Brent, 
a small town next to the main A38 road linking Exeter and Plymouth.</p>
<p>Our five grass courts and one croquet lawn are in play from April to September (depending on the weather), 
while our hard court is available all year.</p>

<p>Originally founded as an archery club in 1859, the club moved to its present site in 1870 and the 
first tennis tournament was held in 1879. We are older than Wimbledon and believe that we are the 
third oldest tennis club in the world still playing on its original courts (after the Edgbaston 
Archery and Lawn Tennis Society and the Bowdon Bowling and Lawn Tennis Club).</p>

<p>Today the club has a membership of around 130 adult and 40 junior members, and we have a thriving program of 
tennis, croquet  and social events and coaching. New members are always welcome.</p>

<p>For membership enquiries please contact  Deirdre Pope at deirdre.pope@some.oxon.org or on 01752 698345. 
Or you may book a court as a visitor for £5 per person/£15 per court by contacting Deirdre as above.</p>


<h1>Directions</h1>

<p>On arriving at Avonwick from Totnes or from the A38 at South Brent, take the road opposite the Avon Arms 
pub (leaving the garage on your left) and head towards the church and village. Turn left opposite the 
church into Black Hall Lane (signposted to North Huish). After you pass Church Walk on your right, 
you will find the club about 200 metres further down the lane through a gate on your left.</p>
